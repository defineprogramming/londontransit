LondonTransit is a discord bot that provides realtime public transport information for London, including the London Underground and the London Bus network, using the [Transport For London Unified API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/).

## Features

#### Real-time information

All returned information is always up to date, meaning that you will always know when your next bus or train is coming, and journeys will always be planned to account for current delays and disruptions.
> *COMING SOON*: /nextarrivals responses updated LIVE (if user selects option)

#### Easy to use

LondonTransit is easy to use, with a simple command structure and a easy-to-read format.

#### View more information

Wherever LondonTransit cant provide detail, LondonTransit will provide a link to the TFL website, where you can find more information. Journey Planner will also display this journey on the TFL website.

## Add to server

To add LondonTransit to your server, click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1109170357568557156). There are two ways to use LondonTransit:
- **Bot user**: Add the bot user to a server you manage. Replies are visible to everyone and can be used by all members, even if they havent added the bot themselves (limited to the server the bot user is in)
- **User app**: Install the app to your personal account, and you can use its commands everywhere, including DMs and Group DMs. (When executed in a server it is not in, messages are forced to only be visible to you if the server has more than 25 members as per Discord policies
