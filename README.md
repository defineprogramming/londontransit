LondonTransit is a discord bot that provides realtime public transport information for London, including the London Underground and the London Bus network, using the [Transport For London Unified API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/).

## Features

#### Real-time information

All returned information is real-time, meaning that you will always know when your next bus or train is coming, and journeys will always be planned to account for current delays and disruptions.

#### Easy to use

LondonTransit is easy to use, with a simple command structure and a easy-to-read format.

#### View more information

Wherever LondonTransit cant provide detail, LondonTransit will provide a link to the TFL website, where you can find more information. Journey Planner will also display this journey on the TFL website.
